# WarChallenge
## Simple card game
###### A very simple app. The project the only purpose is share with other developers a nice sample.

> Some interesting point of this is the use of taptics, wich is presented when users press the button also if you take a look at the code, observe the annotations, I always mark with comments the sections of the code and the branches.
